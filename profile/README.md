## **🚀 PetProject: Automated Candidate Search & Analysis System**

I am currently developing an advanced system designed to **streamline the hiring process** by automating candidate searches across multiple platforms. This system leverages a robust automated search mechanism that scans portfolios using specific keywords.

### **🔍 Intelligent Candidate Matching**

The system integrates a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to parse and analyze candidate details, offering a comprehensive understanding of each candidate's qualifications. Users can input a description of their ideal candidate, and the LLM will assign a **ranking score from 0 to 100**, indicating the candidate's suitability for the position.

### **📊 Data-Driven Analytics**

In addition to candidate matching, the system provides detailed **analytics**, including:
- **Average Age** 🧑‍💼
- **Locations** 🌍
- **Salary Expectations** 💰
- **Experience Levels** 🎓

This project aims to **simplify and enhance** the recruitment process, making it easier for users to find the **best fit** for their job openings.
